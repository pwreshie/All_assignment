This repository contains assignments done.

Assignment 1: A raw and messy data was provided on a marketing firm, which I then performed data wrangling in order to clean it up. The cleaned/sorted data was then written to a csv file.
I wrangled further and created an excel file with three sheets; each sheet containing different information.
I also carried out basic analysis on the data e.g, the most and least performing agents, month with the highest sales etc.


Assignmennt 2: This assignment was based on mining data off a web page. I was tasked with mining certain information of all smartphones on jumia(an e-commerce platform) and writing the data to a csv file.


Asssignment 3: This was based on the previous assignment. I wrote the data mined to a relational database.
